                        Upside Down Loot is identical to Loot except the fact that it&apos;s the opposite. The laws that rule the elements are symmetrical to the ones that rule in Loot.

                        Loot is a collection of 8,000 unique bags of adventurer gear, originally released by Dom Hofmann. At release, anyone could claim loot bags for just gas, and all bags were claimed in under 4 hours. Each loot bag contains 8 items: a piece for an adventurer&apos;s chest, foot, hand, head, neck, ring, waist, and weapon.

                    <p>
                        Loot is an unaudited project. Bags #1 to #7777 were claimable by anyone and #7778 to #8000 are currently reserved for the contract deployer.

                        Why is loot special?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Loot is uniqueâ€”the first project of its kind. With no company, art, team, or attributes, Loot makes it impossible to gate-keep any creative decisions (h/t @john_c_palmer).

                    <p>
                        Loot is the unfiltered, uncensorable building block for stories, experiences, games, and more, in the hands of the community, at no cost. Loot pursues complete decentralization from day one.
